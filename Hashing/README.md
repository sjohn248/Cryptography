I have two programs, one for producing the data "wrapperSHA-1.cpp" and one for producing the graphs "graph.py". 
I compiled on VSCode and lab machines, but primarily used VSCode. wrapperSHA-1.cpp gives run options for whether
you need to enter specific plaintext, run just collision, run just pre-image, or run both attacks. Each besides the specific
plaintext will produce .txt files with data that the python program will interpret and output graph jpgs. 
The zip file includes results that I got on my last run of these programs and the report.
